> Decentralized Blockchain Validator Risk & Incident Reporting Application

Milkyway2 is a cutting-edge Web3 application designed for transparent, privacy-preserving validator incident and risk reporting on Polkadot, Kusama, and parachains. The platform combines real-time validator monitoring with zero-knowledge anonymous reporting using the Semaphore protocol to ensure network security and transparency for both users and validators.

- **TailwindCSS** with shadcn/ui components for modern, accessible design
- **TanStack React Query** for efficient server state management
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized production builds

### Backend Stack
- **Node.js + Express** for RESTful API development
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations
- **PostgreSQL** for reliable data persistence
- **TypeScript** throughout for enhanced developer experience

### Blockchain Integration
- **@polkadot/api** for core Polkadot blockchain interaction
- **@polkadot/extension-dapp** for wallet extension integration
- **@semaphore-protocol** for zero-knowledge proof generation and verification

## üéØ Usage Guide

### For Users: Network Monitoring & Risk Assessment

1. **Connect Your Wallet**
   - Click "Connect Wallet" in the header and approve the connection with your SubWallet or Polkadot.js extension
   - Access all features across Polkadot, Kusama, and parachains

2. **Monitor Validators**
   - Navigate to the **Validators** page to view real-time validator performance
   - Use filters to find validators by risk level (Good/Neutral/Bad)
   - Click "View suggested action" for personalized recommendations

3. **Submit Anonymous Reports**
   - Click "Report Incident" on any problematic validator
   - Generate a zero-knowledge proof to maintain anonymity
   - Submit verified reports to help protect the network

4. **Track Governance**
   - Visit the **Governance** page for active referendum monitoring
   - View voting progress and community participation metrics
   - Stay informed about important network decisions

5. **View Validator Communications**
   - Access the **Message Feed** to see unlocked validator communications
   - Review transparent post-unlock messages about network incidents and coordination

### For Validators: Secure Communication & Risk Management

1. **Access Validator Messaging**
   - Navigate to **Validator Messaging** in the sidebar
   - Connect your validator wallet for identity verification

2. **Generate Encryption Keys**
   - Use the **Key Management** tab to generate secure AES-256 and Ed25519 keys
   - Export keys for backup or import existing validator group keys

3. **Send Encrypted Messages**
   - Use the **Send Messages** tab to compose encrypted communications
   - Messages are cryptographically signed and stored on Passet chain
   - Choose between blockchain or database storage options

4. **Coordinate Risk Response**
   - Securely communicate about network incidents, slash events, or governance issues
   - Messages remain encrypted until governance unlock events make them publicly viewable
   - Enable transparent post-incident analysis while maintaining operational privacy

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reloading
- `npm run build` - Build production application

For production deployment, you can optionally configure a PostgreSQL database via the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. The app will automatically use database storage if available, otherwise it falls back to in-memory storage.

### Risk Classification System

**üî¥ RED (High Risk)**
- Validators that have been slashed
- Commission rates >20%
- Uptime <85%
- Multiple recent incidents

**üü° YELLOW (Medium Risk)**
- Commission rates 10-20%
- Uptime 85-95%
- Some performance concerns
- Mixed performance signals

**üü¢ GREEN (Low Risk)**
- Commission rates <10%
- Uptime >95%
- No recent incidents
- Consistent performance

## üîê Security & Privacy

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Milkyway2 uses the Semaphore protocol to enable completely anonymous incident reporting. When you submit a report:

1. **Identity Generation**: Create a Semaphore identity without revealing personal information
2. **Proof Creation**: Generate a zero-knowledge proof of your right to report
3. **Nullifier Protection**: Prevent duplicate reports while maintaining anonymity
4. **Smart Contract Verification**: zkAttestation contract on Passet chain validates all proofs

### Smart Contract Integration
- **Smart Contracts**: EncryptedGroupMessages and zkAttestation deployed on Passet Chain
- **Verification Links**: Integrated block explorer links for transparency
- **Sybil Resistance**: One human, one signal enforcement through on-chain verification
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Full support for Polkadot, Kusama, and parachain ecosystems
