The EncryptedGroupMessages smart contract is ready for deployment to Passet chain.

## Wallet Information
- **Current Balance**: 0 ETH on Passet chain
- **Status**: Requires funding for deployment

## To Proceed:
Fund the deployer wallet with Passet tokens and deploy immediately.

## Deployment Command
Once funded, run:
```bash
cd contracts
node direct-deploy.js
```

## Expected Output After Funding
```
🚀 Starting deployment to Passet chain...
Deployer address: 0x[WALLET_ADDRESS]
Deployer balance: X.XXX ETH

📍 Contract address: 0x[CONTRACT_ADDRESS]
```

## Next Steps After Deployment
1. Copy the contract address
2. Update `client/src/lib/contract.ts` with the real address
3. Test blockchain submission in Milkyway2 validator messaging

The smart contract infrastructure is complete and ready - just needs wallet funding to deploy to Passet chain.
