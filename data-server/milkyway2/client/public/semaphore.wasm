// This is a placeholder for the Semaphore circuit WASM file
// In a real implementation, you would need to:
// 1. Download the actual semaphore.wasm file from the Semaphore protocol
// 2. Place it in the public directory
// 3. Ensure it's served correctly by the web server

// The actual file would be a compiled WebAssembly binary
// generated from the Semaphore circuit written in Circom
