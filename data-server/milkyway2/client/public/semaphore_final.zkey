// This is a placeholder for the Semaphore circuit trusted setup key
// In a real implementation, you would need to:
// 1. Download the actual semaphore_final.zkey file from the Semaphore protocol
// 2. Place it in the public directory  
// 3. Ensure it's served correctly by the web server

// The actual file would be a binary file containing the circuit's
// trusted setup parameters for zero-knowledge proof generation
